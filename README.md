# sluggin-prototype (React-Native Project)

Slugging, also known as casual carpooling, is the practice of forming ad hoc, informal carpools for purposes of commuting, essentially a variation of ride-share commuting and hitchhiking. A driver picks up these non-paying passengers (known as "slugs" or "sluggers") at key locations, as having these additional passengers means that the driver can qualify to use an HOV lane or enjoy toll reduction.

Just carpooling app to allow people to share commutes and split fares. This is a prototype written in JS and the finale version will be in TS.
